I constantly have this problem! This website was created to help people make use of their free time doing the things that they love. With the help of different API\'s, we are able to provide recommendations on various games, movies, and recipes that you may want to take a look at. These options are then appended to the page dynamically. This website can expand indefinitely with more APIs until there aren\'t anymore that I can add.

Have no idea what to eat for dinner? Take a gander at the \\"Foods that I have eaten!\\" list, or if you\'re feeling daring pick something off the \\"Foods that I haven\'t eaten!\\" list! This was one of my most confusing projects so far just because of the amount of files the model-view-controller (MVC) structure requires and the way information is passed between them to accomplish the goal of putting information into a database. This project was a great place to use express-handlebars because of how seemingly infinitely large databases are.
